Here are extra details for the project:

Part 1: image Classification:

Using a sports image Dataset, we will use 10 classes (trainable on CPU) to train out model. 

using our dataset we have to compare at least two different models. Then we monitor the learning behavior using loss/accuracy curves (using tensorboard)

Explain model decisions with interpretability techniques
Accuracy Score: 20 pts
Training validation : 35 pts
interpretability: 35 pts
reproducibility & design : 10
Part 2: adversarial Attack (100 pts)
implement both target and untargeted attacks against your best performing classifiers
Part 3: model compression (100 pts)
Make the model smaller!!!
Prune the model from millions of parameters to compact, efficient models 

This is covered in 2 weeks

Part 4: Defense and Presentation (Optional) (100pt) (this is 10 extra bonus points ON YOUR FINAL GRADE)

Implementation some defence method against adversarial attacks
